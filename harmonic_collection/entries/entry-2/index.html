    <h7>In Aristotelian physics and Greek astronomy, the sublunary sphere is the region of the geocentric cosmos below the Moon, consisting of the four classical elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
The sublunary sphere was the realm of changing nature. Beginning with the Moon, up to the limits of the universe, everything was permanent, regular and unchanging—the region of aether where the planets and stars are located. Only in the sublunary sphere did the powers of physics hold sway.

<h2>A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</h2>
<h4>John Donne - 1571-1631</h4>
<p>
  <br>As virtuous men pass mildly away,
   <br>And whisper to their souls to go,
<br>Whilst some of their sad friends do say,
   <br>"The breath goes now," and some say, "No,"
<br>
<br>So let us melt, and make no noise,
  <br> No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
<br>'Twere profanation of our joys
   <br>To tell the laity our love.
<br>
<br>Moving of the earth brings harms and fears,
  <br> Men reckon what it did and meant;
<br>But trepidation of the spheres,
   <br>Though greater far, is innocent.
<br>
<br>Dull <b>sublunary</b> lovers' love
   <br>(Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
<br>Absence, because it doth remove
   <br>Those things which elemented it.
<br>
<br>But we, by a love so much refined
   <br>That our selves know not what it is,
<br>Inter-assured of the mind,
   <br>Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.
<br>
<br>Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   <br>Though I must go, endure not yet
<br>A breach, but an expansion.
   <br>Like gold to airy thinness beat.
<br>
<br>If they be two, they are two so
   <br>As stiff twin compasses are two:
<br>Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   <br>To move, but doth, if the other do;
<br>
<br>And though it in the center sit,
   <br>Yet when the other far doth roam,
<br>It leans, and hearkens after it,
   <br>And grows erect, as that comes home.
<br>
<br>Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   <br>Like the other foot, obliquely run;
<br>Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   <br>And makes me end where I begun.
 </p>

 <p>"Liberty is one of the best of all <b>sublunary</b> advantages.
 <br>I would willingly therefore communicate knowledge,
 <br>without infringing, or with as little possible violence to,
 <br>the volition and individual judgment of the person to be instructed."
 <br>
 <br>—William Godwin
