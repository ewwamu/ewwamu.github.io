    <div class="definition">
      <p>From Latin susurrus (whisper, humming),
        from susurrare (to whisper or hum), of
        imitative origin. Earliest documented
        use: 1826. It's not technically an onomatopoeia
        (a word that resembles a sound, such as
        plop or meow), but it's pretty close.
        Susurrus means a soft whisper or
        murmurring sound.

    <div class="origin">
      <h3>did you know?</h3>
        <p>Susurrous derives from the Latin noun
          susurrus, meaning "a hum" or "a whisper,"
          and may be a distant relative of swarm
          (think of the collective hum of a beehive).
          Susurrus is itself an English noun with the
          meaning "a whispering or rustling sound"
          (Stephen King provides us with the example
          of "a violent susurrus of air"). Both the noun
          and the adjective (note that the two are spelled
          differently) are products of the 19th century,
          but they were preceded by the noun susurration,
          which in the 15th century originally meant
          "malicious whispering or rumor." Today susurrous
          is used to describe any kind of sound that
          resembles a whisper: a light breeze through a tree,
          perhaps, or the murmurs of intrigued theatergoers.</p>
