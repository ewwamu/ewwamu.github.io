<h6>a <i>soft</i> murmuring or <b>rustling</b> sound;

<div class="definition">
  <p>From Latin susurrus (whisper, humming),
    from susurrare (to whisper or hum), of
    imitative origin. Earliest documented
    use: 1826. It's not technically an onomatopoeia
    (a word that resembles a sound, such as
    plop or meow), but it's pretty close.
    Susurrus means a soft whisper or
    murmurring sound.

<div class="origin">
  <h3>did you know?</h3>
    <p>Susurrous derives from the Latin noun
      susurrus, meaning "a hum" or "a whisper,"
      and may be a distant relative of swarm
      (think of the collective hum of a beehive).
      Susurrus is itself an English noun with the
      meaning "a whispering or rustling sound"
      (Stephen King provides us with the example
      of "a violent susurrus of air"). Both the noun
      and the adjective (note that the two are spelled
      differently) are products of the 19th century,
      but they were preceded by the noun susurration,
      which in the 15th century originally meant
      "malicious whispering or rumor." Today susurrous
      is used to describe any kind of sound that
      resembles a whisper: a light breeze through a tree,
      perhaps, or the murmurs of intrigued theatergoers.</p>
