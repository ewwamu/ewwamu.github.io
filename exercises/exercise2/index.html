<h1>A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</h1>
<br><i>John Donne - 1571-1631</i>


<p>
<br>As virtuous men pass mildly away,
   <br>And whisper to their souls to go,
<br>Whilst some of their sad friends do say,
   <br>"The breath goes now," and some say, "No,"
<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>So let us melt, and make no noise,
  <br> No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
<br>'Twere profanation of our joys
   <br>To tell the laity our love.
<br>
<br>Moving of the earth brings harms and fears,
   <br>Men reckon what it did and meant;
<br>But trepidation of the spheres,
   <br>Though greater far, is innocent.
<br>
<br>Dull <strong>sublunary</strong> lovers' love
   <br>(Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
<br>Absence, because it doth remove
   <br>Those things which elemented it.
<br>
<br>But we, by a love so much refined
   <br>That our selves know not what it is,
<br>Inter-assured of the mind,
   <br>Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.
<br>
<br>Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   <br>Though I must go, endure not yet
<br>A breach, but an expansion.
   <br>Like gold to airy thinness beat.
<br>
<br>If they be two, they are two so
   <br>As stiff twin compasses are two:
<br>Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   <br>To move, but doth, if the other do;
<br>
<br>And though it in the center sit,
   <br>Yet when the other far doth roam,
<br>It leans, and hearkens after it,
   <br>And grows erect, as that comes home.
<br>
<br>Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   <br>Like the other foot, obliquely run;
<br>Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   <br>And makes me end where I begun.

 </p>
